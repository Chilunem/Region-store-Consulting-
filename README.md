Data

The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

'Superstore.xls': each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd
'orders': details all fields for each ordered item
'returns': details all fields for each returned item

Description:

7-page Tableau Visualization
Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboard.

Assumptions:

Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
The operations department will need to make changes.
The advertising department needs recommendations.

Process:

I first joined the sheets. Then I determined profit and loss centers. Lastly, I examined the contribution returns had on profits.

Findings:

Specific sub-categories were thriving or failing in different regions.
Some products have a negative profit and should be discontinued.
There are some sub-categories that are negative profit and should be discontinued.
There are some sub-categories that are high-profit and should get more focus.
The best advertising regions have different optimal time periods and budgets.
There are several products that have a return rate of 100% and should be discontinued.
The high returns need to be investigated to prevent future problems.
Notes left for Reviewer:

I hid some sheets that I used for my Dashboard titled “Advertising” as I did not want the client to look at them individually. This one dashboard answers the only question in part 2, as it has multiple answers and I felt this was the best way to visualize that.
